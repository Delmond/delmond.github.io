        <h2>Learning and implementing my cryptocurrency</h2>

        Because of a recent (possible) opportunity to work on a cryptocurrency-related job, implementing a 
        cryptocurrency of my own seemed like a good exercise.
        Well, not that you need a reason for learning some new fun concepts.  
        <br/>
        First of all, it's time to collect as much knowledge as possible. As the first resource, I chose 
        <a class="resource" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dgj_OStjD1Q">YT: Digital Currency</a> which 
        is from a youtube channel called thenewboston. He was on a hiatus and only recently started making new youtube videos. 
        He went on to implement his cryptocurrency, and because of this, all his new content is about cryptocurrency. 
        Besides this, I'm biased because I've been watching him since the very beginning and am a big fan of his.
        <br/>
        The three different kinds of servers will be written in Rust using some backend framework (TBD). I'm planning on using
        Docker and Kubernetes to manage and rapidly deploy the different types of servers (also something new to me).
