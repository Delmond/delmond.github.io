        <h2>Learning and implementing my own crytocurrency</h2>
        Because of a recent (possible) opporunity to work on crytocurrency related job, i've wanted to implement my own crypto coin for excercie. To start off, i'm 
        collecting as much knowledge as possible. My first resource is <a class="resource" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dgj_OStjD1Q">YT: Digital Currency from thenewboston</a> 
        who was one of the first tutorial makers i've listened. He took a hiatus from youtube to work on his own crpyto currency and all his new content is about that.
        I'm planning on using Docker and Kubernetis to manage and rapidly deploy the different types of server (and i get to learn something new).
